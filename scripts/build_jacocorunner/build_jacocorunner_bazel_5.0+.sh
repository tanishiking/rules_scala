# Script to build custom version of `JacocoCoverage_jarjar_deploy.jar` from Jacoco and Bazel repositories.
#
# The default `JacocoCoverage_jarjar_deploy.jar` has some issues:
#
# 1. Scala support on newer Jacoco versions (including 0.8.6) is still lacking some functionality
#
#    E.g. a lot of generated methods for case classes, lazy vals or other Scala features are causing falsely missed branches in branch coverage.
#
#    Proposed changes in:
#    https://github.com/gergelyfabian/jacoco/tree/scala
#
#    Backported to 0.8.6 (to be usable with current Bazel):
#    https://github.com/gergelyfabian/jacoco/tree/0.8.6-scala
#
# You can use this script to build a custom version of `JacocoCoverage_jarjar_deploy.jar`, including any fixes from the above list you wish
# and then provide the built jar as a parameter of `java_toolchain` and/or `scala_toolchain` to use the changed behavior for coverage.
#
# Choose the fixes from the above list by configuring the used branch for Jacoco repo below.
#
# Patches:
#
# There are also some patches that may need to be applied for Jacoco, according to your preferences:
#
# 1. Bazel is compatible only with Jacoco in a specific package name. This is not Jacoco-specific, so not committed to the Jacoco fork.
#    See 0001-Build-Jacoco-for-Bazel.patch.
# 2. Building Jacoco behind a proxy needs a workaround.
#    See 0002-Build-Jacoco-behind-proxy.patch.
#
# Set up the patch file names in `jacoco_patches`.
#
# Dependencies:
#
# On OS X greadlink is needed (by running `brew install coreutils`).
